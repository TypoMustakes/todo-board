### Todo Board — Minimalist Task Manager

Todo Board is a lightweight, terminal-based task manager. It was designed for those who value a clean, distraction-free workflow and want to manage their daily tasks without leaving the command line.

The core philosophy of this project is practicality and minimalism. Instead of complex interfaces, it uses simple ASCII frames and ANSI colors to keep your list organized, fast, and intuitive.
